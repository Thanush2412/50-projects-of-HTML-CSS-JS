                <h3>What is a Progress Bar?</h3>
                <p>A progress bar is a graphical control element used to visualize the progression of an operation such as a download, file transfer, or installation.</p>
                <p>In this case, we're using CSS to create a progress bar that fills up based on how far you've scrolled down the page.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Section 2</h2>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
                <p>This progress bar works using a clever CSS trick with a pseudo-element and viewport units.</p>
                <p>As you scroll down, the width of the progress bar increases proportionally to your scroll position.</p>
                <p>The entire implementation is done using only HTML and CSS - no JavaScript required!</p>

                <h3>CSS Grid Layout</h3>
                <p>This page uses CSS Grid to organize the content sections. Grid is a powerful two-dimensional layout system that makes it easy to create complex layouts.</p>
                <p>Each content section is placed in the grid, allowing for clean organization and responsive design.</p>

                <h3>Fixed Position Elements</h3>
                <p>The progress bar at the top of the page stays fixed as you scroll. This is achieved using CSS's position: fixed property.</p>
                <p>Fixed positioning removes an element from the normal document flow and positions it relative to the viewport.</p>

                <h3>CSS Variables</h3>
                <p>This demo uses CSS variables (also known as custom properties) to define colors and other values that are reused throughout the stylesheet.</p>
                <p>CSS variables make it easy to maintain consistency and make global changes to your design.</p>

                <h3>Responsive Design</h3>
                <p>The layout of this page adjusts based on the size of your viewport. Try resizing your browser window to see how the layout changes.</p>
                <p>Responsive design ensures that your website looks good on all devices, from desktop computers to mobile phones.</p>

                <h3>Scroll Events</h3>
                <p>While this demo uses only CSS, scroll events are commonly handled with JavaScript in more complex applications.</p>
                <p>CSS-only solutions like this one are great for simple use cases and for learning the fundamentals of web design.</p>

                <h3>Performance Considerations</h3>
                <p>CSS-based scroll effects can be very performant because they leverage the browser's rendering engine without the overhead of JavaScript execution.</p>
                <p>However, complex CSS animations and effects can still impact performance, so it's important to test on various devices.</p>
